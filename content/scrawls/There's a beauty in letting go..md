well then! not exactly how we had planned the blog move to happen, but suffice to say, it was fated to be this way. or, if you're not the type to believe in [fate](), uh... The logical progression of how this brain works would have led to the same or similar outcome regardless of what the initial less-founded plans were. or something.

[the old blog posts](https://rinion.studio/#/blog) are still around, but not linked to directly! it's a bit of a runaround. reworking every single post back into markdown for this is really not worth the effort when they're perfectly fine as they were written, and it's not like they're *gone*... even the old, old, *old* versions of the site are buried somewhere in version history. they just aren't needed front-and-center anymore.

together with moving the blog, i want to focus a little more on putting more soul into the posts rather than just acting as an activity roundup whenever i would have the energy to make those. stream-of-consciousness is alright, but a bit harder to do when so much consciousness is streamed to different nodes and not really recorded *live*. i guess it comes with the territory of moving toward scripting videos, solidifying our sense of self, getting all this shit sorted for the first time in (probably) forever? not like it makes sense still, ofc.

so! i am! letting go! of the old blog! my hope, my prayer, my will, is to be more true to myself here and not just devolve into saying things in a place that is designed specifically for saying things. no moving carousel of images, no others to distract from what's being said.

just a blog, of sorts. a diary, maybe.

i'd call it a grimoire, but we're saving that for the portfolio. speaking of, i should really *buy* that one instead of waffling about it. maybe that can be the next post!

I have a very hard time letting things go. There's plenty of reasons as to why, but,...eh. The important part, I think, is that I'm finally trying to get worse at holding on. And that's quite the task! But overburdening myself to keep up with everyone I know, to respond to everything quickly, to Do My Best to the detriment of myself, that ain't healthy. And with the world being made a more hostile place in many areas for what I would be, as I realize just *how* overstretched I've held myself, it is time to withdraw some to get done what I find important to me., though, without becoming a hermit. Basically, I gotta stop acting terminally online and only be normally online.

I can't catch every show, every stream, consume every piece of media that interests me all at once, and certainly not while trying to keep up with all of my friends *and* work on projects and hobbies and my own shell.

I was going *somewhere* with this, I swear... Oh, yeah. I guess, quite substantially, I also have been letting go of both my 'need' to correct things I disagree with, and my urges to debate someone out of a bad mood. Some things can just be, and I can't make myself be responsible for it all. ~~doesn't stop me from still trying! old habits die hard.~~
