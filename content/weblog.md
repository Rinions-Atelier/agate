hi :)
new site design here we gooooooooooooo

i've been playing a ton of Elden Ring!! and talking to a lot of ppl and just generally being really busy while i had the strong itch to rework everything again, so here we are.

i also took a whole trip up to Anime North, actually, back at the end of May. was a good time, probably gonna go again next year. want to see if i can hit Japan this year over winter, maybe?

letting go of the graphics was a *hard* choice to make, but i made it, and i'm happy with the result enough to stick to it. the biggest upside of this is how much easier it is for me to make small updates without hating everything about the process (i was not put on this bitch of an earth to pick "fullstack developer" as one of my *hobbies*; if the site feels like it's a job, why aren't i getting paid for it!!).

looking to get back to drawing more regularly now. and speaking of, i need to finish dragging all the alt text over from the previous iteration. rather annoying to convert that across formats, so i only got the more recent stuff fully filled out. ugh.

i keep losing track of time!

ok, that's not entirely true. i've just been busy with life, and sorting some things out on the mental backend.

i made [a comic](https://www.tumblr.com/rinion-b/747715878409355264) after talking about some identity related stuff with some friends. it's odd to have all that even partially just out for the world to see, but since stuff makes more sense when i sit down and write it out, i might as well condense the explanation in case i need to toss it at someone else in the future, eh?

been getting back into the groove of just writing a bunch on a forum i joined last month, and also been going back into the Project Moon brainrot, so i haven't been drawing as much outside of that. will probably do some plein air and physical stuff during my trip soon (heading out to Anime North to chill with some friends), and then i imagine i'll be a lot less stressed once i'm back from that. but it's also just been nice to not have to stress over drawing for a minute and relax. i know it's good to keep the muscles moving, and i'll def expect to be paying for it once i come back, but i'd rather take a long break than burn out.

besides, i still have ideas. i'm just focusing on other things, and trying to remind myself that it isn't actually _a criminal offense_ to take time off and focus on health and stuff.

i've also started streaming again, and since i don't _think_ i've put my twitch link anywhere besides my alt twitter account: orbitlll is the new name. used to just be rinion__, but the double underscores annoyed me for 5 years and i figured it was time for a change.

what else... oh, yeah, there's the JVC Videosphere. i chanced upon one a month or so back, haven't had time to really break into it and slap a converter on it (the clock is the only broken thing, i just need to get into it and clean up the rest of the shell), but maybe i can do that soon. feels like i'm short on time, but i do recognize i'm also trying to juggle a lot.

oh, wow. where did february go? i finished the VisDev class (nothing to share here at the moment, though i am considering a separate URL page on the site for portfolio and class work somewhere down the line), and that took up till the end of the month which explains the absence, but it _really_ doesn't feel like it's been that long since i checked in.

there's a lot of thoughts i've been tossing around on my existence, which may prompt an update also of my about section (not really anything major, more so the conveyance of the ideas that were already there i suppose?). i did originally plan to shave that writing down into a post here, but if i do still decide on that later there's more work to do to make it all fit.

i can at least put a fraction of it here, since i am here.

i don't want to be famous.  
i don't want to be a professional artist.  
i want to keep making art.  
i want people to see my art.  
i enjoy drawing digitally.  
i feel tethered to the computer, and not just because the outside world with its pollution of air and noise and weather i am intolerant to feels a near constant threat to be comfortable hiding away.  
i feel like i'm hiding, but haven't the slightest idea what from.  

a lot of my thoughts are spurred on by other people i follow getting me to start thinking, since my default state regrettably does not do a lot of the introspection on its own (i do still dwell in my head a lot, but without an impetus i am more often found (by myself, i guess? grammar is odd) theorycrafting something that might go nowhere, or mentally drafting a drawing). which does sometimes contribute to the impostor syndrome (the label on the bottle is "human" rather than any of my skills), but i am happy with considering it just the result of my internalized and habitual disinclination to talk about myself.

...

reading Devil House (and then i think Universal Harvester?) by John Darnielle. taking me a minute to get through bc life is a bit rough lately, but i'm enjoing it.

joined an art class (VisDev). will maybe post some more as it goes, but so far it's been nice (if starting off much longer than i'm used to sitting in lectures). makes me want to dedicate a portfolio tab here, but i also have my showcased work to display, so for now i'm fine not adding that.

rest of the life sched is honestly a mess, but the vibes for the year have been alright so far. want to get back into streaming more regularly, but there's a lot standing between me and that rn tbh.

### 22
took a bit longer to get back to writing here, whoops. december's almost over, and i don't quite have the energy in me to make a "end of the world" statement here right now.

definitely feels like it, as usual, though.

anyway.

since the last update, i've been pretty busy. got an ebike, have been trying to get back into shape between that and kyudo and fighting my allergies off, and got really wrapped up in secret santas and commissioned work and figuring out what the hell i want to work towards in 2024. i'm _probably_ traveling twice, aiming for maybe a third stop somewhere if i'm not worn out between canada and...well, i gotta pick between friends in cali, japan, and australia for the second one, so it depends on how much the canada trip is to recover from. definitely aiming to get out before the last quarter of the year (when i usually end up sick for a bit, or at war with my allergies).

the ebike's been helpful. haven't had the chance to ride it for the commute bc it's a _little_ too cold to safely be transportation these months, but i have some winter gear on the way and i just need to sort out some ear protection and we should be fine.

yknow, i'm actually kinda surprised how easily i was able to work on things this and last month with how much has been going on irl and in my head here. i was able to hop in on a secret santa (can't show that one yet, it's not time!), a [character design telephone](https://twitter.com/nyaivie/status/1735899858345607605) (the poster's account is 18+, the post itself is just mildly to moderately NSFW depending on your work environment and how far along you're looking in the progression), and also got to work on a friend's visual update for [community emotes](https://twitter.com/worldlocalproxy/status/1736379995856019647) as well as [writing for the announcement](https://twitter.com/__negg/status/1732687052704186396).

despite not having a lot of Stuff™ to show off for the end of the year as a collage this time around, i'm pretty happy with where i'm at. definitely a lot to get done and work on in the next one, between an art class proper and the traveling and all, but compared to the start of the year or even the pace of last year i am a lot more comfortable with my skill level and work speed (once i get out the gate). we'll see where the new year takes us.

speaking of, i was honestly surprised that i got called in to _write_ for neg, even though i had mentioned picking it up again recently. it's not something i'd offer to most vtubers or even most people in general, but it is a very welcome change of pace from the art. i think the easiest way to put it is also why the emotes were so much fun; i understand what she was looking for because i've been around in her community for 3 years now. i could write for a number of friends if they wanted me, but i don't think that i would be able to do it half as easily as something that was intended for a community i've seen rise and fall and rise again. streamer assets and streamer work often ends up feeling very 'cookie-cutter' to me outside of a very few graphic designers and artists (seol for instance), which extends to a lot of emotes and lore being sort of YCH-style. or at least that's how i read it. it doesn't motivate me to get involved in the community, i can say that much. i'll do what i can for the people that i know, but if i was okay with running the races in the vtuber space or even just the streamer space, i don't think i'd have as much to say on it nor would existing be as much trouble as it is for me creatively.

:3

now, to end on a lighter note, there's a fun new game out called [Path of the Abyss](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1768650/Path_of_the_Abyss/), and i want to play it. you may have already seen it on the left side with all the other recommendations. i was part of the playtest group (2?) and now it's finally hit early access, so i can have more fun with it. i'm _going_ to play it over the holiday break i have this next week. i'm gonna stream and play games and draw and maybe fuck around in VR again for the first time properly in months. i need to find more ways to enjoy being around online for me, because that's the only way that i'm gonna stay engaged to want to show off my OCs and the world in my head and all the stuff that i'm interested in. maybe once i lock in a regular comfortable time (thinking potentially sundays and/or a couple weekday evenings my time) i could get into doing some live dev work? maybe? again, very subject to how much my 2024 plans are gonna eat into me and my schedule. whatever happens, maybe swing by? it's just rinion__ on twitch; assuming the website doesn't follow the Twitter ⇒ X downfall pipeline, i'm gonna keep streaming there since i already have it set up, and maybe on day edit some stuff down for youtube.

...okay.

<span style="color:blue;">House</span> of Leaves. it's time to talk about this. spoilers will be avoided where i can, but not entirely.

oh my god where do i even _start_ with this thing. it's a massive ride, from start to finish, and i do believe it's capable of doing to the reader similar things that it does to the...narrator? first editor? owner? i honestly picked it up on a whim after seeing people mention it a few times in the previous month, and it's one of those cases where i knew from the instant i looked it up that i would love it. that it would be waiting there to eat up my life until i could finish it. and that's honestly kinda dangerous! i do still have a job and other stuff i need to do. thankfully, it's the size of a dictionary, and i couldn't easily bring it into the office with the stuff i needed to have at the time.

on to the book itself, now, it exists in at least 4(?) layers. the Navidson Record, the life of the Navidsons, Zampanò's insanity, Johnny's life story, the distortions Johnny brings to the story, the final edited version, the book itself as an experience beyond just the textual component, the additional materials—

ok, that's a bit more than 4. but you get what i mean. the longer you spend in this book, the more it gnaws at you. even though i finished it in the course of roughly a week, maybe 30 hours cumulatively of reading, i can still feel it worming around in my brain. i've seen the <span style="color:blue;">house</span> come up in 2 separate things since, one an explicit reference in a doom map, the other in the game Buddy Simulator (and in that one i still can't tell if that was deliberate or from circumstance), and the structure of the book as a whole, its layout the same as the Navidson property, the words winding and flipping and reversing and tunnelling and jumping around like the corridors of that pitch-black featureless labyrinth—

like

what the hell? it's such an experience of a book, and i need to get my hands on more that play with the medium in even remotely similar ways. maybe the house really did make me (more) insane too, maybe that's why i've felt such a drive to write lately. something that i haven't felt this strong in years, even with how often i do end up writing to analyze series or just spew thoughts out into the internet for others to interact with or ignore or respond to.

i want to reread it already... but i need to stay strong. read the other ones i've had on a list. finish this site. give it time before i come back for another expedition.
### 08
ending off the book club right quick (for now) (i gotta get back to working on the assets here) with a couple books that deal in depression and stuff.

<small style="color:pink">disclaimer that my brain does not work in a way that is conducive to getting medical-class depression (despite environments that are), and may never end up wired that way. so i will generally be bad at properly empathizing with the experience, and most certainly do not consider myself qualified to talk on it.</small>

anywho.

the first one, the one i read a ways back, It's *Lonely at the Centre of the Earth*. drawn and written and made by Zoe Thorogood. this is one was the small bridge of time between finishing the ShortBox comics i had picked up in October and the start of the week-long-journey through House of Leaves, and we're still riding that vibe.

...i really do have a favorite metagenre.

anywho(2).

It's Lonely, or ILCE, or however people try to shorten the title to make it easier to type (please ignore how i am spending far _more_ words in total justifying this attempt than i would simply using the full title in the entire rest of this post), is one of my favorite comic books. graphic novels? autobiography but in the literal sense, a graph (drawing) of someone's life done by themself, with all the internal fuckery that entails. i honestly love a lot the representation of what i take to be Zoe's internal perceptions of herself, be it her childhood self, her near-featureless 'comic author' (perhaps?) version and the way her depression is drawn to be entirely alien but still included in the mental 'family'. it's (not the depression, the whole set) something that i personally appreciate since there's part of my own mental model i see in it..

the paneling and metadiscussion, as is appropriate for something of autobiographical nature, is also really well done. i haven't read anything else Zoe's done yet, though i do plan to when i next end up on a book shopping spree, especially since this was so well put together. especially considering it was made as a sort of vlog through her depression. even seeing her tell her story, some times it's still hard for me to imagine what it must have been like. but i do still understand? bc of how it's written. it's weird to put that into text but hopefully you get what i mean by that.

now, the second book, *Wolf in White Van*, was written by John Darnielle, and while it is on all accounts entirely different from *It's Lonely at the Centre of the Earth*, i still find it coincidentally similar enough. it's a piece of fiction, made by the lyricist of The Mountain Goats (you should listen to them: [1](https://open.spotify.com/track/5cxnSTLzGD1t9xcdmJYFVB?si=6b4deb1223394433) [2](https://open.spotify.com/track/2TYXkQaCOLC8nzJx01ZWKj?si=b50e37fb080b4587)). assuming you're following along with the subtext and either listened to those songs already, know them, or are listening to them now as you read the rest of this, hopefully you can understand the appeal of the prose-style lyrics and why the same person who wrote these would be so well-suited for writing an entire book.

it's really great. long story short, and this long story really does come across as a short one if you pass over the gaps it leaves, it's a semi-reversed-chronology telling of the life of one Sean Phillips, the mail-based turn-based role-playing game "Trace Italian" he invented and runs, and the lives his intersects with. it quite honestly bears a lot of resemblance to how Sean talks about the Trace Italian (game) itself, the way things can be boiled down to simplicity on a piece of paper but take on much more meaning for the readers and in the context of each person's journey.

the forward-and-backward layout of events, the way it avoids detailing _too_ much of the individual details of what exactly happened, leaving much of it up to the imagination beyond key details, the ending not being a surprise so much as it is unexpected if you let it lead your thoughts in one of the possible directions, and all of it comes together to make a compact and dense story that you may end up mentally reading in reverse once it comes to a close (or partway through as you make some connections).

maybe you've noticed that i'm not explicitly drawing parallels between these two in the latter half. you should go read them to understand why i find them similar :3

_books!_ (and some comics)

going to toss a bunch of thoughts on comics i picked up at this year's online [ShortBox Comics Fair](https://www.shortboxcomicsfair.com/). i'll do another one in a minute for the more full-length-release-sized stuff, like <span style="color:blue;">House</span> of Leaves and *It's Lonely at the Center of the Earth*. these thoughts are mostly adapted from twitter with some changes for better readability, since i think i did manage to get my thoughts out well at the time.

1. perhaps one did not so much want to be loved so much as to be understood (by jujud_6)

honestly, the title speaks for itself. it's a very nice feeling when someone understands. to have someone who you can actually talk to. it's strange how easy it is for people to still not understand, that they have never encountered it and tried to engage with it, to understand it. that people would rather try and get you to provide what you can't sustain because it's easier for them. obviously this is about being ace, or on a similar scale aro, but i do think there's probably a lot of capacity for anyone else with a limited expression or living under arbitrary expectations to get something out of this one (and the video).

as long as they're willing to stop and think. god, more people who can communicate. please

2. When Death Comes, I Will Follow (by val wise)

love the setting. the synopsis details it, pardon my lack of remembering (at time of editing this down, the catalog is gone since the fair only lasts a month), but essentially anything that dies is _removed_ from the world? the paneling, framing, spacing, and all that is done really well. particularly at the end. I'd love to see a little bit more of the world, but it does well as a self contained story for sure.

3. My father was a good man (by Adeline Kon)

oooh, page 25-26. very nice. very strong spread panels and playing with panels/framing. that's probably one of the things i love seeing most in a comic (see: witch hat). the sort of 3-act structure, looping callbacks, also love that.

i think if i read this last year, i might have less to say on the story beats, the family. but... yeah. the process of growing up, growing past your parents, even if they are still alive, can be rough. learning to not idealize them. good intentions are not an excuse. man.

4. Blue Hour (by M.Suarez-thai)

(editing note: there's obviously a comparison to make to Blue Period and the way that also approaches the idea of finding a passion, but that feels excessively on-the-nose and i left it out deliberately)  
i tend to struggle to relate to characters that are searching for/in need of social circles; most of my motivations are more selfish. there's still enough for me to connect with here though, which is nice.

maybe one day I'll join a band. or start one. i do want to get good enough to record and post covers, for example, or do some live jamming on stream.

5. About Agatha (by Bieffe)

honestly, i felt like i was missing a metaphor until the author extra at the end. kinda ironic that i just read one on overthinking and then proceeded to overthink an entire read. the cover and last page art contrasts nicely with the more frantic(?) story pages. i do think this is the part of the fair that I'll consistently understand the least or have the least to say about, so uh yeah oops it is what it is. thumbs up emoji @ the romance and the physical stuff i don't get it but glad other people do

6. The things we carve (by Chan Chau)

this is the one that i learned about the comic fair through, iirc. lived up to my expectations from the cover, though i couldn't put to words exactly how. obviously i am very biased toward anything that deals with mechanical work in the realm of magic, but honestly it's also just a really chill musing on creativity and i feel at peace reading it. especially since I've been running into walls myself lately, trying to work on something of a similar importance to me.

7. i'm stuck in retrograde (by jade zhang)

70 pages! that's a lot.  
the staircase as a pseudo in universe element is interesting. it took a minute to tell myself that i shouldn't overthink it (like usual)

...sometimes i do wonder how much i am also prone to getting lost in the noise, but this is someone else's story. feels kinda selfish to try and get into my own right now, even if that's what I've been doing for the fiction already.  
(and maybe that's it's own issue. but we will agree to continue ignoring it for a while.)

8. come home safe

physical + digitized? feels very physical. triple layered chronology but playing out weaved together. wondering how far the callbacks go narratively, and how much I'm allowed to read in between.

unrelated to the previous bit, but i do definitely feel like my own love for space and attraction to the void make some mood settings land... off target. i recognize what it's probably going for. it mentally doesn't quite line up.

9. SOMEONE DIED HERE

...  
damn!  
i think  
this should be read at night.  
with the lights off.  
no music playing.  
:)

ok with that out of the way. incredibly well done. instructions for the reader for best intended experience, followed by Very Good pacing. I'm stuck on what else to say! the plot is not _revolutionary_ i wouldn't say but it's executed very well mechanically. the artist also has a great grasp on how to make things unsettling, which is played into nicely. highly recommend reading this one, if nothing else.

10. connector (by bothpalms)

space murder mystery! i love the dialogue and pace of the writing. sometimes the speech bubbles felt a bit hard to follow, but not a deal breaker.  
that's kinda it! I'm running out of thoughts lol

11. IT ALL ENDS WITH ME (by laweyd)

tbh i thought about reading this last, but when have i been thinking that hard about order at all?

i definitely talk about paneling and pacing a lot, so pardon that coming up again (or don't), but laweyd uses it to... isolate? the book/world both feel very empty and devoid of life, but in a good way. this sort of meta worldbuilding (?) is something I'm a really big fan of. it also leads really well into the concluding chapter.

12. To you, my ghost (by mochipanko)

this might be the only one I've picked up (at least so far) that reads right->left? it's still in English, of course.

between this + other comics dealing with grief, as well as some other incidental reading, there's this fragment of a thought having to do with memory. i can't get it to words, so obviously i can't write it here. maybe if you read these as well you might be able to figure out what I'm thinking before i do. knowing my own thoughts and feelings was never a strong point.

... that's not really about the comic, though.

i definitely feel like I'm running out of things that can be said that i haven't said already elsewhere. which is expected, but it feels kinda unfortunate for the ones I'm reading last.

i guess it's fine to just say "good read."

13. fishing (by Joe Sparrow)

"the ocean is big. there are plenty of fish, and you have a lot of time."

having a mind still enough to properly think, it's a concept i wish i could grasp properly. meditation is fine. working is fine. but sit me down without anything and i will just go insane unless there's music or something to ground me. and i honestly don't have a clue if that's a problem to fix or just how i am and i need to learn to work around it.

14. The Gold (by Maggie Olson)

i... honestly I'm not sure if i have anything to say at all? maybe I'm just missing the point on this one, but i kinda don't 'get it' enough to have an opinion. idk. was expecting to run into this sooner, but somehow, most of my choices have worked.

15. There's Life After the Impact (by Sara Call)

impermanence and assumedly a little bit of post apocalypse. very up my alley. I've never really been into antique browsing, but is that similar? idk.

16. A Three Body Problem (by Tan Juan Gee)

another space murder mystery! god i love space and sci-fi done well. i picked a good one to end on. definitely in the top 3 from this group because it's just really solid.
