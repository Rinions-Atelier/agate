Hello!

This is the *n*th iteration of my carving an constellation into the stars flickering on server racks, a return to form and function over graphic aesthetic in order to better serve as what I want out of it.
One day, this too shall pass. <small>if it survives a year, it might make it longer. who knows?</small>
Enjoy me while I last.
